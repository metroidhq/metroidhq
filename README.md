#### Do NOT commit directly to master or dev.
Instead, make your own feature branches off dev, and submit pull requests against dev when you want something merged in. We will be following [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), so please familiarize yourself with its concepts.
